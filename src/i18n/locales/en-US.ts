      'Code996 is an analysis tool that can count the commit time distribution of Git projects, and then deduce the coding work intensity of this project.',
    howToUse: {
      title: 'How to Use',
      localAnalysis: 'Local analysis: In the root directory of the Git project, execute the following command:',
      scriptUrl: 'https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/hellodigua/code996/bin/code996_en.sh',

    howItWorks: {
      title: 'How It Works',
      step1:
        '1. Use git-log to query the current branch of the project to get commit statistics aggregated by hour and by day',
      step2: '2. Convert the query results from the local script into URL parameters and open the URL in the browser',
      step3: '3. Get data from the URL, process it with some rules, and visualize the results',

      point2: '2. Identify the workaholics in the company',
      point3: '3. Compare the overtime intensity of different projects',

    safety: {
      title: 'Is It Safe',
      point1: '1. Neither the script nor the web side will collect any data',
      point2:
        '2. Except for general data such as analysis start time and commit results, the URL itself does not leak sensitive information such as project names',
      point3: '3. All codes are open sourced to',

      title: 'Other Questions',
      q1: 'Q: What is the 996 index?',
      q1a1: 'The 996 index is a metric defined by this project to reflect project overtime intensity.',
      q1a2: 'After standardizing the overtime situation, we can conveniently compare the work intensity of cross-team and cross-company projects.',
      q2: 'Q: When are the analysis results of code996 inaccurate?',
      q2a1: 'The script counts the overall commit time of the project by default, representing the work status of all participants in the project during this period, which may deviate from personal actual conditions',
      q2a2: 'In addition to coding, we also need meetings, documentation, learning, taking breaks, etc., so it cannot cover actual working time',
      q2a3: 'Cross-national and cross-time zone development projects cannot be correctly counted',
      q2a4: 'Projects with irregular working hours (such as personal open source projects) cannot be counted either',
      q3: 'Q: Problems with the script?',
